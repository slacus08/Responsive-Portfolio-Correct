			<h2> About Me </h2>

			<br>	
				<p> Born and raised in Baltimore, Maryland, I grew up cheering on the Ravens in the fall and the Orioles in the Spring. I attended college at High Point University in North Carolina where I studied Political Science and was very active on campus as a D1 athlete, Equestrian team member, and involved in my sorority, Zeta Tau Alpha.
				</p>
			<br>
				<p>Since moving to the DC metro area, I've worked in politics, non-profits, and consulting. Currently, I reside in Arlington, VA with my college sorority sisters, and my puppy named Pippa. I also have a horse named Larry who lives at a family farm in Baltimore.
				</p>
			<br>
				<p>I recently became interested in working in the IT sector and am excited to see where this coding bootcamp takes my professional career.
